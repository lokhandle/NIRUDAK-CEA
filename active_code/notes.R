# will at some point need to go back and change ICER to be consistent new assumptions made here

# note in manuscript: YLL is the mean among all patients of a branch in which patients die
# e.g., true Severe dehydration but model-assigned "No" or "Some" dehydration
# check Jonah's code w/ statistical tests comparing the distribution of ages
# across branches between the two models
# he did find statistically sig. differences in age between branches (in exploratory_analysis_of_trial_data.R)
# can run the analysis both ways (with mean YLL across whole sample and with average age in each branch)

# YLD is based on patients in the Sharifi paper who were hypernatremic (high sodium levels)
# 234 patients got IV fluid, of those 24
