(1) costs assuming you would use the model's predicted amount of liquid and to triage
    *Oral fluids
    *IV fluids
    *hosp costs
    *time off work

productivity costs assumptions
 #(1) short-term everyone gets 6 hurs and hos los (so everyone gets 6 hrs loss and then they go back to work unless
	admitted to hosp.
     none lose 3 hrs
     some 9
     others lose 3 hrs + hosp
 #(2) long-term only
hosp costs
  assume onlyf if severe
 but sensitivity analysis where those misclassified go to hosp
	for length mean severe

 #if model predicts hosp then actual

(2) costs assuming you would use the model only to triage and as category. 
    so you assign liquid costs based on category
    *Oral fluids
    *IV fluids
    *hosp costs
    *time off work
